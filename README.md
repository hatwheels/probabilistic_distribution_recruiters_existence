# Recruiters' existence

Let us assume that everyday all recruiters in the world do one of the following 4 things:

 1. Retire
 2. Hire developers
 3. Recruit 2 recruiters and retire
 4. Recruit 3 recruiters and retire

Is there any chance that a day comes that no recruiter exists anymore?

The goal is not to find mathematically the probability that no recruiter exists on day __t__, but to calculate with python script the probability distribution of the number of recruiters __n__ after the end of day __t__: 

What is __n<sub>t+1</sub>__ given any __n<sub>t</sub>__?
